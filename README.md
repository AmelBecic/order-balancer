# Full-Stack Decentralized Order Book Exchange

This is a complete, real-time trading platform that uses an off-chain server for matching orders and an on-chain smart contract for settling trades on the Sepolia testnet.

## üìã Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Docker & Docker Compose**: [Install Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- **Node.js**: Required for the smart contract deployment
- **A Web3 Wallet**: Like MetaMask, configured for the Sepolia testnet

## üöÄ How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-project-directory>
```

### 2. Create .env File
Create a file named `.env` in the main project folder and add the variables listed below.

### 3. Start the Application
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

The application will be available at **http://localhost:8080**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables (.env)

You must create a `.env` file in the project's root directory with the following variables:

```env
API_V1_STR=/api/v1
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
MONGODB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017
DATABASE_NAME=your-database-name
RABBITMQ_URL=amqp://localhost:5672
BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS=["http://localhost:8080"]
SETTLEMENT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...your-contract-address
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/your-api-key
BACKEND_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key-here
```

### Environment Variable Descriptions

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `API_V1_STR` | The prefix for the API, usually `/api/v1` |
| `SECRET_KEY` | A secret key for the backend |
| `MONGODB_URL` | The connection URL for the MongoDB database |
| `DATABASE_NAME` | The name of the database to use |
| `RABBITMQ_URL` | The connection URL for the RabbitMQ message queue |
| `BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS` | A list of allowed origins for the backend, e.g., `["http://localhost:8080"]` |
| `SETTLEMENT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` | The address of your deployed Settlement smart contract on the Sepolia testnet |
| `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` | Your RPC URL for the Sepolia testnet (e.g., from Alchemy or Infura) |
| `BACKEND_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` | The private key of the wallet that will pay for gas fees to settle trades |

## üìù What This App Does

### ‚ö° Real-time Trading
The order book updates live as users place and cancel orders.

### üîÑ Off-Chain Matching
A Python-based worker instantly matches buy and sell orders.

### ‚õìÔ∏è On-Chain Settlement
When a trade is matched, the backend calls a smart contract to securely swap the assets on the Sepolia blockchain.

### üîê Wallet Authorization
Users must connect their MetaMask wallet and sign every order, ensuring all actions are secure and user-approved.
